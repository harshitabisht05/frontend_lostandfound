# 🎒 Lost & Found Portal (Ongoing Project)  

This is an **ongoing Major Project**: a web-based **Lost & Found system for college campuses**.  
The idea is to allow students to **report, search, and recover lost items** in a simple, cloud-enabled portal.  

We are currently working on the **frontend (Next.js + TailwindCSS)** and will later integrate the backend, database, and cloud deployment.
